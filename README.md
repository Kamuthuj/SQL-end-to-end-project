In this project, I designed a central database management system for a car auto shop which aimed to change operations by monitoring and optimizing revenue, stock management and sales across the different products. I created a RDBMS which had clear relationships and foreign keys between tables. Data was later loaded in the database and did different SQL queries to get data insights. Using Power Bi, I created a dashboard and used a filter of the products to show different sales of goods across through different parts, and was able to unravel different purchasing patterns of the different products
