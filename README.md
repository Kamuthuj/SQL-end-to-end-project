My SQL project aims to develop a central database management system for a car auto shop to monitor revenue, stock and the items sold in different parts. This is to streamline the sales of goods and provide data insights on the products sold.
data base design:
I created a relational data base management system for the stakeholders which I was able to clearly establish relationships and foreign keys between the tables for easy data retrieval. I wrote SQL scripts to create the database schema.
Using the provided data, I loaded data into the different respective tables and made queries which would provide insights on the purchase of their products based on different price points and different parts within Kenya.
I created a connection for MySQL workbench where I used the available data to create visualizations to view performances of the different products. I preferably chose the filter, as It would be easy to generate details and insights of each product in depth. Pivot tables also played a key role as I used DAX formulas to create new tables which aided in calculating totals for different rows within my data.
